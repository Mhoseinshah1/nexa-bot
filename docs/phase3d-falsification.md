# Phase 3D — falsification record

Every production rule this branch added or changed, the mutation that reverts
it, and what the suite did. A rule with no test is a rule that will be silently
reverted; a test that stays green under mutation is not a test.

Each row was run: revert the rule, run the named suite, restore, re-run.

## Three tests that could not fail when first written

Recorded because it changes what they are worth, and because the cause is the
same each time: **the test's input and its subject came from one place.**

**F-I — the planned-route test.** It read `path` from `PLANNED_SURFACES` and
then checked that `resolve` served that path. A typo moved both together, so
the assertion stayed true of a route no link points at. `NAV` hardcodes
`/users` and `resolve` looks the route up from `PLANNED_SURFACES`; those are
the two independent declarations, and the test now drives the NAV path — what
an operator clicks — and dies under a typo on either side.

**F-E — the notification cursor.** Two versions passed with the tie-break
reverted. `Clock.now()` is read per call, so intents queued normally get
distinct timestamps and a timestamp-only predicate walks them perfectly. The
committed version writes rows sharing one `created_at`, which is the only
state in which the two implementations differ.

**F-C — the CSP test.** Its first version waited on the dashboard card's
header, which renders while the query is still in flight. It photographed a
loading skeleton, found no `style` attribute in it, and passed for the wrong
reason. It now waits on the rendered data.

## The visual harness

Falsified as a tool, not just used as one (F-J). It has now caught fixture
drift from the frozen schemas **three times** on this branch — a feature flag
missing `source` and carrying an invalid `blastRadius`, the new
`schedulerCapacityExceeded` field, and the `nextCursor` the notification
response gained. Every time the symptom was identical: one route rendering its
error state or a skeleton in all three views, with nothing else wrong. The
`stillLoadingAfterSettle` and `showingErrorState` counters are load-bearing,
not decorative. It also had a defect of its
own: it printed its summary and wrote nothing, so a `verification.json` from an
earlier run sat on disk looking current — and its numbers were nearly reported
as a clean pass for a run that had produced none. It now writes the summary
into the output directory, beside the captures it describes.

# Round 2 — the thirty-four Codex threads

The first round's table above is kept as written, including F-H, which this
round deleted. That row is the reason this section exists: a rule can be
falsified cleanly and still be the wrong rule. `rows.length === PAGE_SIZE`
dies under `rows.length > 0`, which is what F-H proved — and it is also true
of a page that is full and final, which is the defect Codex found as T06. A
mutation test tells you a rule is load-bearing. It does not tell you the rule
is right.

Every row below was run by `scratchpad/falsify/run.py`, which for each rule
applies the mutation, runs the named suite, requires a FAILURE, restores the
file and verifies the hash matches byte-for-byte, then re-runs and requires a
PASS. A rule whose mutation left the suite green, or failed it for a different
reason than the one named, is not listed as killed — two did on the first
attempt and are recorded under "Two mutations that were wrong" below.

**39 mutations, 39 killed, 0 survivors.** Contract-package mutations rebuild
`@nexa/contracts` before the run: the suites import the package's `dist`
through the workspace link, not its source, so a mutation without a rebuild
tests nothing. That is itself a finding — the first attempt at the T08 mutation
reported a survivor and was a stale build.

## Two mutations that were wrong, and what they taught

**The contracts package is imported as `dist`.** The first T08 mutation edited
`packages/contracts/src/settings.ts` and reported a SURVIVOR: the negative
amount was still refused. It was refused by the previous build. Vitest has no
alias for `@nexa/contracts`, so every suite resolves it through the workspace
link to `packages/contracts/dist/index.js`; a contract mutation without a
rebuild changes nothing the tests can see. Every contract-level row above now
rebuilds first. (`pnpm typecheck` emits that `dist` as a side effect, which is
why it can look fresh without anyone having run `pnpm build`.)

**A half-reverted rule fails for the wrong reason.** The first T17 mutation
changed `limit: size + 1` back to `limit: size` and left the
`found.length > size` test in place. The suite failed — but on
"walks the whole history with a cursor", because the half-mutation drops one
row per page, not on the full-page case the rule is about. `nextCursor` came
back `null`, which is what the fix wants, for a reason the fix does not have.
The mutation now restores the original expression exactly, and kills the
intended test.

Both are the same lesson from the other side: a mutation that fails is not
evidence until you have read WHY it failed.

# Round 3 — reviewing the fixes as hard as the bugs

Round 2 closed 34 findings and was verified green. Two independent reviews of
those 34 fixes then found **23 more**: thirteen from a fresh-context
adversarial pass over the five remediation commits, ten from Codex, four of
them the same defect seen twice.

The number that matters is not 23. It is **two**: two of the findings were
regressions that round 2's own fixes introduced, and a third was a rule that
round 2 certified as falsified and that was nonetheless wrong. That is the
third time on this branch that a fix has needed a fix, and it is the reason
this file exists rather than a summary in a commit message.

## The two regressions

**The over-fetch made the maximum page unreachable.** Round 2 changed both list
endpoints to ask for `size + 1` so `nextCursor` could mean what it says. The
ops-log service ceiling was raised to 201 to leave room; the notification
service ceiling was left at 200 — the wire maximum. So `GET /notifications?limit=200`
asked for 201, got 200, computed `found.length > size` as `200 > 200`, and
answered `nextCursor: null` with rows still behind it. The fix traded a false
cursor for an unreachable page, which is the worse of the two: an empty page
can be navigated away from.

**The restore control orphaned the retirement row.** Round 2 gave the Web Admin
an archive/restore pair and chose to restore to `DISABLED` rather than `ACTIVE`,
so that nothing silently resumes dialling a machine an operator archived. That
choice is right and it broke `RESTORED_CODE`, which was keyed on
`status === 'ACTIVE'`: the transition closed nothing, and the later
`DISABLED -> ACTIVE` step saw a `before` that was no longer archived and did not
close it either. The retirement row was then open for the life of the
installation with no path that could ever close it — and the panel was being
probed while the operations log said it was archived and unmonitored, which is
verbatim the state that code exists to prevent. Reached through the only
control that offers a restore.

Both were invisible to a green suite, and neither was a mistake in the change
that was reviewed. They were mistakes in the seam between that change and the
code around it.

## Three of round 3's own tests could not fail

Caught by the harness before they were committed, which is the whole point of
running it rather than citing it.

| test                              | why it could not fail                                                                                                              | what it is now                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| the concurrent-rename regression  | it re-rendered with the same query key, so the cache served the old row and the "concurrent" change never arrived                  | driven through a real refetch — a status change invalidates the panel query, which is how the row actually arrives under an open form |
| the CSP dashboard stub            | removing `nextCursor` again left it green: the card rendered its error state and the `[style]` assertion passed over a broken page | asserts no skeleton and no error state before asserting anything about style attributes                                               |
| the credentials stale-value guard | see below — it was testing something that cannot happen                                                                            |

## A finding that was real in shape and not reachable

The review held that `PanelDetailPage`, not being keyed by panel id, could carry
a typed API token from one panel to another whose provider does not accept it.
The guard was added; the test written for it passed with the guard removed.

The reason is that the scenario cannot occur: changing the id changes the query
key, the query goes pending, `StateSwitch` renders a skeleton, and the whole tab
subtree unmounts with its draft state. A probe established this rather than an
argument.

So the guard stays — it costs nothing and it is correct — and **no test claims
to falsify it**. What is committed instead is a test that pins the fact the
guard depends on: if a future change keeps previous data across the id, or drops
the loading branch, that test fails and the guard stops being redundant. A
guard whose justification is a behaviour elsewhere should fail when that
behaviour changes, not when it does not.

## The 21 mutations

All killed, each requiring a failure for the named reason, a byte-for-byte
restore, and a pass afterwards.

| U07  | initial credentials need the rotate permission                  | `if (false)`                       | _refuses initial credentials from an actor who may not rotate them_        |
| U07b | ...and the form does not offer them                             | drop `mayRotate` from `accepts`    | _offers no credential field to an actor who may not rotate credentials_    |

| U09  | an unusable stored credential stays visible                     | `shows = accepts`                  | _keeps an unusable stored credential visible and removable_                |
| U13  | the loading state unmounts the credentials draft                | render children while loading      | _unmounts the credentials draft when the panel changes_                    |

Plus V07b, which earned its place immediately: the panel-detail stub in the
route sweep was returning the LIST shape, so that route had been rendering its
error state throughout the sweep and nobody had looked. The assertion added to
catch a hypothetical caught a real one on its first run.

## What this round changes about the method

Round 2's record already said that a mutation test tells you a rule is
load-bearing, not that it is right. Round 3 adds the other half: **a fix is a
change to a seam, and the seam is what needs reviewing.** Every one of the two
regressions above was correct in the file it was written in. One was wrong
about a ceiling in a different module; the other was wrong about a guard three
hundred lines away. Neither would have been found by re-reading the diff.

## Round 4 — two mutations, and one half-fixed rule

Codex's fourth review reported ten findings against `aafebab`, and nine of them
named work that was already in the tree when it read the branch. The tenth did
not: _"Gate all edit and credential controls on the archived state, not just
the test button."_ The fix written for round 3 removed the **Save button** on an
ARCHIVED panel and left the **name and base-URL inputs enabled**.

That is a smaller version of exactly the same untruth. An operator can still
type a new name into a form that has no way to submit it, on a panel
`PanelService.update` answers 412 for. The gate is now one `mayWrite`, and the
two inputs and the button share it.

The test that was supposed to protect this rule asserted only
`queryByRole('button', { name: 'ذخیره' })` — so it passed on a half-fix, which
is how the half-fix shipped. It now asserts the fields as well, and a second
test asserts the opposite direction, because widening a gate is one character
away from disabling the form for everybody.

| #   | rule                                         | mutation                          | test that dies                                            |
| --- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| W01 | the identity INPUTS follow the archived gate | inputs back to `!mayEdit`         | _offers no save on an archived panel_ (`toBeDisabled`)    |
| W02 | ...and only on an archived panel             | invert to `status === 'ARCHIVED'` | _leaves the identity fields editable on a live panel_ + 3 |

W01 was killed for its named reason (`expect(element).toBeDisabled()` on the
name field, with the Save assertion above it still passing — the half-fix
reproduced exactly). W02 killed five tests, the two above plus the three
existing draft-basis tests, which is the correct blast radius for disabling the
form outright. `apps/web/src/pages/panels.tsx` was restored to
`b24b219e0362cc59cf49cf20266da62f024dc1b8a9eb6a7687e219e2c9b38d93` after each,
and the suite returned to 35 passed.

**The lesson, which is round 3's lesson applied to itself:** an assertion that
names one control does not cover a rule about controls. Four review rounds have
now each found their defect inside the fix written for the round before, and
this one was found inside a fix whose own falsification record says "killed".
A mutation test proves a rule is load-bearing. It cannot prove the rule is
_wide enough_, because the mutation and the assertion are written from the same
understanding.

## A correction to this record

Auditing every test this document names — 54 citations across rounds 2, 3 and 4 —
found **one that did not exist**. Row U09 claimed the mutation `shows = accepts`
was killed by a test called _keeps an unusable stored credential visible and
removable_. The production fix was real and correct; the test was never written,
so the mutation had never actually been run against anything.

That is precisely the failure `CLAUDE.md` names as worse than making no claim at
all: the next reader believes a coverage that does not exist, and the rule is
free to be reverted silently. The test now exists in `tests/web/panels.test.tsx`,
the mutation was run against it for real — it fails on the missing
`حذف — توکن API` button — and the source was restored to sha256
`b24b219e0362cc59cf49cf20266da62f024dc1b8a9eb6a7687e219e2c9b38d93` afterwards
with 36 passing.

One further citation, R-19, named its test in the interpolated form
(`/panels/%E0`) rather than the `it.each` template (`/panels/%s`), so a literal
search for it failed. The test exists; the citation is now written as it appears
in the source, because a citation nobody can grep for is halfway to a citation
that is not true.

The audit itself is the durable part: **every rule in this document is now
name-checked against the test files**, and a name that does not resolve is a
defect in the record.
